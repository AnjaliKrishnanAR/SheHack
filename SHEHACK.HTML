         <p class=irine>As of my view SheHack is an event organised for empowering women in technical field.
          The reason behind me joining SheHack is that 'I strongly believe that  SheHack  
          is the best platform where I will be able to learn new technical skills and also 
          help my peers in learning these skills.</p>

            <P class=irine>I'm excited, nervous, confused and determined all at the same time. 
                I have never been involved in anything like this before. This is my first hackathon.
                 I have never before been given the opportunity to develop a project from the ground up.
                  For me, it's a next step in my education. I hope this contest will be the beginning of 
                  a strong foundation. As I look back at my life, I can see the opportunities that have 
                  been missed . It's going to be a challenge to realise them now.</P>
